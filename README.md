### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Setup & Testing

### How to Test Push Notifications

1. **Get Device FCM Token:**
   - Run the app. The FCM token will be logged in Logcat with tag `FCM_TOKEN` and shown as a Toast on app start.
   - Copy this token for use in Firebase Console.
2. **Send Test Notification:**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Cloud Messaging > Send your first message.
   - Enter a title and message.
   - Under 'Target', select 'Single device' and paste your device's FCM token.
   - Send the message.
3. **Observe Notification:**
   - If the app is in foreground, a Toast will display the message.
   - If the app is in background or killed, a notification will appear in the system tray.

### Notes
- The app logs and displays the FCM token on every launch.
- The app handles both notification and data payloads.
- The FCM service is declared in the manifest and handles token refresh automatically.
