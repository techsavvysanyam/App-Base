## Current Status

The object detection feature has been simplified to focus on UI components only. The ML detection functionality has been removed.

## UI Components

The object detection UI includes:
- Camera preview functionality
- Gallery image selection
- Results display area
- Object detection overlay for bounding boxes

## Camera Functionality

The app still supports:
- Camera preview using CameraX
- Image capture from camera
- Image selection from gallery
- Permission handling for camera access

## Note

Object detection ML functionality has been disabled. The UI components remain intact for future implementation or demonstration purposes.
